My Advent of Code 2018 solutions

Should work in Python 2.7 and 3.x, but only tested in 3.7.

General usage should follow:
```
$ python3 day1.py input.txt
```

You can also enter input via stdin, use EOF marker (Ctrl+D) when finished sending input.
When using stdin, your input format should match the AOC txt file input format.
```
$ python3 day1.py -
1
2
3
<Ctrl+D>
```
